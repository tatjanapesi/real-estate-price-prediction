# Real Estate Price Prediction

This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques in Python. It includes several Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is **not included** in the repository due to size restrictions.  
You can place your own CSV files in a local `data/` folder if you want to run the notebooks.

## Technologies and Libraries

This project uses Python and the following libraries:

- `pandas` – for data manipulation  
- `numpy` – for numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` – for data visualization  
- `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`) – for machine learning models  
- `warnings` – to manage warnings in notebooks  


## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatjanapesi/real-estate-price-prediction.git
```
2. Install required libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. Make sure your dataset CSV files are located in the folder you specified in your notebooks.

Notes:
The project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and prediction modeling.
The notebooks are independent and can be executed one by one.
Large dataset files are not tracked in GitHub to comply with file size restrictions.
